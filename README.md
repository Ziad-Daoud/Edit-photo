# 🖼️ Photo Editor (C++)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **console-based photo editing application** developed in **C++**.  
It allows users to apply a wide range of image processing filters and transformations
through a simple text-based menu interface.

The project was originally created as a **university assignment** and later cleaned,
organized, and published for **portfolio and learning purposes**.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`)
2. Ensure all .h files are in the same directory as the .cpp file.
3. Compile the project:
```bash
g++ CS213_A3_Part2_S28_20240227_20240546_20240624.cpp -o Image-Editor
/Image-Editor
```
4. Follow the on-screen menu to load images and apply filters.

## 📌 Notes

- All interactions are performed via the command line interface.
- The focus of the project is on logic, algorithms, and clean C++ code rather than GUI.
